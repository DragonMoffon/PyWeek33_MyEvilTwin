Signal is a pattern matching game with 3* levels. 
You are a signal coordinator who must match and oppose the enemies signal.
If you don't you will take damage as the enemy successfully attacks. Survive 3 rounds,
and you will be able to send the signal to attack back.

##settings
To change settings use [A] and [D] to select different options,
and use [W] and [S] to change the settings value.

##controls

To play the game use the [<] and [>] keys to change the frequency of your signal.
Try match the enemy's frequency. 
Use [^] and [v] to change the peak of your signal. Try to oppose the enemies peak.

press [SPACE] to send out a signal. You will hear a ping when it is best to send out your signal.

You are trying to cancel out the enemy's signal at the dashed line.
So when the enemy Signal reaches the thick line is when it is best to send out your signal.

settings knob which says 'translate' and 'off'. When you select translate the game will pause.
